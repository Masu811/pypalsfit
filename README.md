# Pypalsfit

This Project is an adaptation of [STACS](https://gitlab.lrz.de/tum-frm2-positrons/stacs) for PALS.

This is a big construction site, nothing is guaranteed to work and documentation is coming soon (if at all).

Keep in mind that this project only works on Unix systems (due to hardcoded filepaths).
